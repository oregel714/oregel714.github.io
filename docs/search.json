Ever since then, I’ve spent a lot of time and effort honing my ability to take the kinds of pictures that I enjoy taking. There’s nothing very professional or intrinsically valuable about my photography, however, I can say that I really enjoy my own work and the scenes that I observe and choose to capture. I hope you enjoy them too.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptured by Kacie Ta @ Harvey Film Labs (Check them out!)\n\n\n\n\nI’ve had the privilege of being surrounded by people who allow me to photograph them in their environments, thus allowing me to capture their candid likeness. To me, this is the most critical part of my work, and to be completely honest, the reason why I do it in the first place. The following photos are some of my favorite portraits that I’ve taken of my friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nMateo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI and Hayden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKacie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelissa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthan"

    "text": "I started playing guitar in 2023, but really took to it once I moved to Santa Barbara for school. I understand that it’s a cliche to take up the guitar in college, however, I understand why now. Not just the guitar, but certainly playing any instrument is an excellent use of one’s time and energy. In this day and age, it’s so easy to get sucked into your phone or your computer screen. An instrument allows you to disconnect from everything else and plug into something that is difficult and requires you to focus to achieve proficiency. Once you’ve practiced enough, you can begin to express yourself, and I find that really beautiful."

    "text": "Digging soil pit #1 during our 3-day Mojave Desert field trip.\n\n\n\n\nWithin my undergraduate coursework at UCSB, I had the opportunity to enroll in ENV S 114A - Introduction to Soil Science and ENV S 114B - Soils of California. These classes, instructed by Iris Holzer, allowed me to get my hands dirty both metaphorically and literally. 114A was an introduction to soil classification, properties, and its connection to many other fields of environmental studies. While this was a very informative class on its own, I chose to pursue soil further in taking 114B the following winter quarter. I can safely say that this is one of the best decisions I could’ve made as far as choosing coursework. In 114B, we deep-dived into soil classification learning, not only how to classify a wide range of soils, but also the methodology and practices that contribute to safe and fun field work for my peers and I. These two courses were truly the highlights of my senior year experience at UCSB and stand as a true testament to the value of hands-on learning and experience outside of the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurple Skies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning about indigenous rock art!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris instructing students how to read a local soils map."

    "text": "My name is Mark Oregel. I’m from Santa Ana, California, and I’m studying Environmental Studies (B.A.) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am currently a Garden Operator at the Green House and Garden Project, a community garden located in Isla Vista. I enjoy playing guitar, going on runs, and taking pictures.\nMy future plans involve going back to school and working towards getting certified in something environmentally related. This can be in the form of an engineering certificate, GIS certification, or even a master’s degree in an environmental field. I really enjoyed the soils classes that I took in my undergrad, and I hope to pursue something related to working with farmers or underprivileged communities to ensure they’re protected from malpractice or exploitation. My goal thus far in my education has been to be able to give back to my community in whatever I end up choosing as a career. I look forward to the coming years after my graduation."
