They needed to be able to trust my calls on a dime without any form of hesitation, I needed to be able to trust that they would do what I demanded of them.

Since I was a coxswain, I wasn’t required to erg or do the regular training that many of the rowers were required to do. I admired their dedication to putting in the hours of training that they so willingly put in. Erging is not an easy task to simply perform but I suppose that when you get to the level that the rowers were on, you could erg for what seemed like forever. Some would play movies or shows during hour-long erg sessions, maintaining consistency with their pacing and form. I would begin to dwindle after just twenty minutes."

In my time on the team, I got to experience two instances of real competition. The first is when we faced off against OCC right before spring break of 2024 and the second was later that same year at WIRA: Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship. This was an incredibly nerve-racking experience for me as I was still new to coxing and had never coxed in such an intense environment. We were up against seven other boats, I honestly can’t even remember the place we came in. I just remember how fun it was to see the novice men give it their all in the seven minutes and thirty seconds that it took us to get to the finish line."

I am currently a Garden Operator at the Green House and Garden Project, a community garden located in Isla Vista. I enjoy playing guitar, going on runs, and taking pictures.\nMy future plans involve going back to school and working towards getting certified in something environmentally related. This can be in the form of an engineering certificate, GIS certification, or even a master’s degree in an environmental field. I really enjoyed the soils classes that I took in my undergrad, and I hope to pursue something related to working with farmers or underprivileged communities to ensure they’re protected from malpractice or exploitation. My goal thus far in my education has been to be able to give back to my community in whatever I end up choosing as a career. I look forward to the coming years after my graduation."

    "text": "I started playing guitar in 2023, but really took to it once I moved to Santa Barbara for school. I understand that it’s a cliche to take up the guitar in college, however, I understand why now. Not just the guitar, but certainly playing any instrument is an excellent use of one’s time and energy. In this day and age, it’s so easy to get sucked into your phone or your computer screen. An instrument allows you to disconnect from everything else and plug into something that is difficult and requires you to focus to achieve proficiency. Once you’ve practiced enough, you can begin to express yourself, and I find that really beautiful.\nHere are some photos of my guitars:\n\n\n\n\n\nIan holding his squier\n\n\n\n\nAt a Christmas party in 2012, my cousin Ian (pictured above) approached my brother and I with a guitar in his hands and a Santa beard poorly taped on his face. The guitar was a 2003 Squier Stratocaster and it was the first guitar I’d ever really played. It was actually meant for my brother but he took it to boarding school where it was promptly mounted onto the wall because “it looked cool” and never played. Eventually Eric went to college and, before he could display it in his dorm room once more, I stole it from him on the basis that I would try to learn it. It now leans proudly against an unmounted Smiths poster and next to my computer for when I feel the urge to thrash on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nJazz Master B)\n\n\n\n\nSince the summer of 2024 when I lived in IV for summer sessions at UCSB, I was perusing Facebook market place one day and found this awesome Squier Jazzmaster for sale just down the street from me. Two days later and it was leaning right next to my first guitar at the foot of my bed.\nI think it’s awesome that I’ve been able to play the guitar that my cousin used to play when he was in a band. There’s something special to me about the idea that I’m playing the same guitar he used to play. I don’t know why, I just can’t shake it."

These classes, instructed by Iris Holzer, allowed me to get my hands dirty both metaphorically and literally. 114A was an introduction to soil classification, properties, and its connection to many other fields of environmental studies. While this was a very informative class on its own, I chose to pursue soil further in taking 114B the following winter quarter. I can safely say that this is one of the best decisions I could’ve made as far as choosing coursework. In 114B, we deep-dived into soil classification learning, not only how to classify a wide range of soils, but also the methodology and practices that contribute to safe and fun field work for my peers and I. These two courses were truly the highlights of my senior year experience at UCSB and stand as a true testament to the value of hands-on learning and experience outside of the classroom.\n Mojave Landscape and Indigenous Rock Art\n Iris and the Crew\n Our beautiful planet"
