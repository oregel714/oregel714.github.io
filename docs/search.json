These classes, instructed by Iris Holzer, allowed me to get my hands dirty both metaphorically and literally. 114A was an introduction to soil classification, properties, and its connection to many other fields of environmental studies. While this was a very informative class on its own, I chose to pursue soil further in taking 114B the following winter quarter. I can safely say that this is one of the best decisions I could’ve made as far as choosing coursework. In 114B, we deep-dived into soil classification learning, not only how to classify a wide range of soils, but also the methodology and practices that contribute to safe and fun field work for my peers and I. These two courses were truly the highlights of my senior year experience at UCSB and stand as a true testament to the value of hands-on learning and experience outside of the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurple Skies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning about indigenous rock art!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris instructing students how to read a local soils map."

    "text": "I started playing guitar in 2023, but really took to it once I moved to Santa Barbara for school. I understand that it’s a cliche to take up the guitar in college, however, I understand why now. Not just the guitar, but certainly playing any instrument is an excellent use of one’s time and energy. In this day and age, it’s so easy to get sucked into your phone or your computer screen. An instrument allows you to disconnect from everything else and plug into something that is difficult and requires you to focus to achieve proficiency. Once you’ve practiced enough, you can begin to express yourself, and I find that really beautiful.\nHere are some photos of my guitars:\n\n\n\n\n\nPIan holding his squier\n\n\n\n\nAt a Christmas party in 2012, my cousin Ian (pictured above) approached my brother and I with a guitar in his hands and a Santa Beard poorly taped on his face. The guitar is a 2003 Squier Stratocaster and it was the first guitar I’d ever really played. It was actually meant for my brother but he took it to boarding school where it was promptly mounted onto the wall because “it looked cool” and never played. Eventually Eric went to college and, before he could display it in his dorm room once more, I stole it from him on the basis that I would try to learn it. It now leans proudly against an unmounted Smiths poster and next to my computer for when I feel the urge to thrash on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nJazz Master B)\n\n\n\n\nSince the summer of 2024 when I lived in IV for summer sessions at UCSB, I was perusing Facebook market place one day and found this awesome Squier Jazzmaster for sale just down the street from me. Two days later and it was leaning right next to my first guitar at the foot of my bed.\nI think it’s awesome that I’ve been able to play the guitar that my cousin used to play when he was in a band. There’s something special to me about the idea that I’m playing the same guitar he used to play. I don’t know why, I just can’t shake it."

Ever since then, I’ve spent a lot of time and effort honing my ability to take the kinds of pictures that I enjoy taking. There’s nothing very professional or intrinsically valuable about my photography, however, I can say that I really enjoy my own work and the scenes that I observe and choose to capture. I hope you enjoy them too.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptured by Kacie Ta @ Harvey Film Labs (Check them out!)\n\n\n\n\nI’ve had the privilege of being surrounded by people who allow me to photograph them in their environments, thus allowing me to capture their candid likeness. To me, this is the most critical part of my work, and to be completely honest, the reason why I do it in the first place. The following photos are some of my favorite portraits that I’ve taken of my friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nMateo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI and Hayden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKacie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelissa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelechi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnisha"

I am currently a Garden Operator at the Green House and Garden Project, a community garden located in Isla Vista. I enjoy playing guitar, going on runs, and taking pictures.\nMy future plans involve going back to school and working towards getting certified in something environmentally related. This can be in the form of an engineering certificate, GIS certification, or even a master’s degree in an environmental field. I really enjoyed the soils classes that I took in my undergrad, and I hope to pursue something related to working with farmers or underprivileged communities to ensure they’re protected from malpractice or exploitation. My goal thus far in my education has been to be able to give back to my community in whatever I end up choosing as a career. I look forward to the coming years after my graduation."
