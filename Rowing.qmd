My rowing journey began when my old housemate Holden approached me about potentially joining the rowing team. I laughed in jest at his absurd implication that I was somehow a proper fit for the team, a team comprised mainly of 6 foot titans who eat, sleep, and breathe rowing. Holden explained that I could become a coxswain, the individual responsible for barking orders and steering the boat. I'd never saw myself as the type to cox but, given my slim build and ability to project vocally, I thought I'd give it shot. 

Eventually, after attending a few practices, I realized how unique of a position I was in. The coxswain sits in the back of the boat facing the eight rowers who are blind to the direction we're traveling in. As a photographer, I soon saw an opportunity to capture my point of view as, not only a coxswain, but a spectator of the rowing world of which I was novel to.

Waking up at four in the morning five days out of the week wasn't exactly the most attractive aspect of being part of the team, however, it kept me disciplined in completing my homework in a timely manner. I had not realized how much I relied on staying up late to complete assignments until I couldn't afford to. Staying up till 12 AM doing homework meant only four hours of sleep before having to get up for practice. Yeah, not happening. 

After a few weeks, I was in it. I started working out with the team because a coxswain who trains with their crew gains their trust and maybe some respect. My word was the final say, no ifs, ands, or buts. If I said to keep rowing over a waterfall, they'd better buckle up without a peep. They needed to be able to trust my calls on a dime without any form of hesitation, I needed to be able to trust that they would do what I demanded of them. Building this mutual respect would require showing them that I'm not just sitting pretty in the boat all the time, but that I too am familiar with their pain as we're barreling towards the finish line with fatigue fully setting in.
