I first started taking pictures when I was in high school, more specifically, in my introduction to photography class my freshman year. Ever since then, I’ve spent a lot of time and effort honing my ability to take the kinds of pictures that I enjoy taking. There’s nothing very professional or intrinsically valuable about my photography, however, I can say that I really enjoy my own work and the scenes that I observe and choose to capture. I hope you enjoy them too.
