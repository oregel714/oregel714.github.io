Within my undergraduate coursework at UCSB, I had the opportunity to enroll in ENV S 114A -  Introduction to Soil Science and ENV S 114B - Soils of California. These classes, instructed by Iris Holzer, allowed me to get my hands dirty both metaphorically and literally. 114A was an introduction to soil classification, properties, and its connection to many other fields of environmental studies. While this was a very informative class on its own, I chose to pursue soil further in taking 114B the following winter quarter. I can safely say that this is one of the best decisions I couldâ€™ve made as far as choosing coursework. In 114B, we deep-dived into soil classification learning, not only how to classify a wide range of soils, but also the methodology and practices that contribute to safe and fun field work for my peers and I. These two courses were truly the highlights of my senior year experience at UCSB and stand as a true testament to the value of hands-on learning and experience outside of the classroom.
