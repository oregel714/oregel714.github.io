My name is Mark Oregel. I’m from Santa Ana, California, and I’m studying Environmental Studies (B.A.) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am currently a Garden Operator at the Green House and Garden Project, a community garden located in Isla Vista. I enjoy playing guitar, going on runs, and taking pictures.
