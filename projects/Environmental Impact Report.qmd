## Overview

This focused environmental impact report (FEIR) was completed as a result of ENV S 165B Impact Analysis wherein the goal is to complete an FEIR given a hypothetical development scenario. Using the skills we learned in the class, we conducted a site visit and determined environmental impacts of a hypothetical housing development to be located at Campus Point on the UCSB campus. While hypothetical, most aspects of the class were treated as a real scenario. We worked with maps and figures of the proposed development site creating visualizations to convey any and all impacts on our resource of choice. I chose to write about Recreational Resources.
